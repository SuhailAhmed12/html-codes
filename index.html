        The basic understanding of growth begins with a fine ability to think logically. Coding is fundamental in sharpening logical reasoning and think creatively. 21st Century has digitally progressed and the technological development has made it possible for everyone to have access to learn to code. üöÄ

        We believe kids should learn to code at an early stage and we at Coding Blocks will help our students so as they can benefit them to refine their thinking process and visualize abstract concepts through programming. We'll focus to hone their organizational skills. üíØ
        
        Our teachers will also help them to improve their creative abilities and develops a sense of confidence in them that prepares the kids for the future.
        
        With this vision, we will be teaching Python, C++, Web Development, App Development, Java, and many more courses for free to 1st Grade to 12th Grade High School Students under our new initiative Coding Blocks Junior! ‚ù§Ô∏è
